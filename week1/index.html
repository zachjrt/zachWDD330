            Master Mobile UX notes

            Start with smallest simplest
            Need to adapt to new technology
            Iphone changed everything (2011 shifted)
            2-3 devices per person per household.
            Do mobile first
            Easier to build up than squish down
            Mobile is not a fad
                Why havenâ€™t more companies made this switch?
            
            Know users better than they know themselves
            Be quick
            75% use thumb
            Make things easy to reach
            Loading can make people want to leave
            Reduce image usage
            Svg/webfonts
            Optimize and minify css and js
                
            
            Better ux
            Menu on bottom easier to reach
            Improve engagement rate
            Hamburger
                Why is Menu better than hamburger?
            Focused simplified
            Float labels
            Paginate
            Enable autocomplete
            Show pass/hide if needed
            If number bring number keyboard
            
            Link numbers
            
            Make ads fit for mobile
            Pop up is terrible
            Small simple
            unobtrusive
                Empathy is big, why are ads still so bad?
