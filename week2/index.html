A set can be converted into an array by placing the set, along with the spread operator directly inside an array literal.
</p>


<p>
A function that is passed as an argument to another function is known as a callback.
function sing(song,callback) {
if(typeof(callback) === 'function'){    callback();}
function dance() {
sing('Let It Go',dance);
</p>

<h4>How much can callback functions help with readability?</h4>

<p>
remember basic arithmetic rules for math
</p>

<p>
The && operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result is true only if both the values given to it are true.
</p>

<p>
The || operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values given to it is true.
</p>
